//what is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
public class Assignment16 {
    // in Java, a local variable is a variable that is declared inside a method,
    // constructor or a block of code, and it can only be accessed within that block.
    // On the other hand, an instance variable is declared inside a class, but outside any method or block,
    // and it can be accessed by any method or block in the class. Another difference is that a local variable has to be initialized before it can be used,
    // while an instance variable is automatically initialized with a default value if it is not initialized explicitly.
